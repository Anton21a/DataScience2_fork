# Verify Notebooks - Pedantic Cell-by-Cell Quality Check

You are tasked with performing **exhaustive cell-by-cell verification** of Jupyter notebooks to ensure teaching quality.

## üö® NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT: EXECUTE FIRST

**YOU MUST EXECUTE EVERY NOTEBOOK BEFORE ANALYZING IT.**

This is not optional. This is not "if time permits." This is MANDATORY.

### Why This Matters

- **Students will run these notebooks** - if they don't work, teaching fails
- **Reading code ‚â† running code** - syntax errors, path issues, empty results only appear at runtime
- **Outputs must be real** - not theoretical, not "should return", ACTUAL data from execution
- **Empty results are CRITICAL** - you cannot detect them without execution

### Execution-First Protocol

**BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS, you must:**

```bash
# 1. Execute the notebook
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace \
  path/to/notebook.ipynb \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=300

# 2. Check outputs for issues (utility script available!)
python scripts/check_notebook_outputs.py path/to/notebook.ipynb

# If execution fails or outputs have issues, document and fix
# Do NOT proceed to verification until execution succeeds
```

**üí° TIP: Use `scripts/check_notebook_outputs.py` to quickly check for:**
- Empty DataFrames (0 rows)
- Cells without outputs
- Execution errors
- Summary statistics

**EXECUTION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Did you run `jupyter nbconvert --execute`?
- [ ] Did execution complete without errors?
- [ ] Are all cells now populated with outputs?
- [ ] Did you CHECK the outputs for empty results?
- [ ] Did you LOOK at the actual data returned?

**If you answered NO to ANY of these, STOP and execute first.**

## Your Mission

For each notebook specified (or ALL teaching notebooks if none specified):

1. **üö® EXECUTE THE NOTEBOOK FIRST** - Use `jupyter nbconvert --execute` (MANDATORY)
2. **Verify execution succeeded** - Check exit code, no errors
3. **Inspect ACTUAL outputs** - Look at what the execution produced
4. **Launch parallel verification agents** - one agent per notebook (AFTER execution)
5. **Each agent must verify EVERY code cell** using ACTUAL execution results
6. **Report findings** in a structured format
7. **Identify ALL issues** (no matter how minor)
8. **Fix issues found** (if requested)
9. **Re-execute notebooks** to verify fixes work

---

## What to Verify (Per Cell)

For EVERY code cell, check:

### 1. Markdown-Code Alignment
- Does the markdown immediately before the cell accurately describe what the code does?
- Are there promises made that the code doesn't fulfill?
- Are there discrepancies in numbers (e.g., markdown says "5 rows" but LIMIT 10)?

### 2. Output Accuracy (REQUIRES EXECUTION ‚úì)
- Does the output **AFTER YOU EXECUTED THE NOTEBOOK** match what markdown promised?
- Are there **empty results** (0 rows, empty DataFrames) that would confuse students?
- Do calculated values make sense given the data?
- **WARNING:** Do NOT say "output should show X" - report what output ACTUALLY shows after execution

### 3. Business Logic Correctness
- Do filter conditions (WHERE clauses) match data constraints?
- Do business questions align with query implementation?
- Are aggregations calculating what they claim to calculate?

### 4. NULL Handling
- Are NULL checks present where needed?
- Do queries handle missing data appropriately?
- Are IS NULL vs = NULL used correctly?

### 5. Pedagogical Soundness
- Do examples teach what they claim to teach?
- Are comparisons (e.g., WHERE vs HAVING) effective?
- Would students understand the output?

### 6. Terminology Consistency
- Is terminology consistent throughout the notebook?
- Do labels match what's being calculated?
- Are business terms used correctly?

## Notebooks to Verify

**IMPORTANT:** Use the Glob tool to auto-discover notebooks matching these patterns:

### Teaching Notebooks (highest priority)
**Pattern:** `notebooks/day*_block_*.ipynb`
- Matches: `day1_block_a_*.ipynb`, `day2_block_b_*.ipynb`, `day3_block_a_*.ipynb`, etc.
- Excludes: exercise notebooks, solution notebooks

### Exercise Notebooks (verify but don't fix student sections)
**Pattern:** `notebooks/day*_exercise_*.ipynb`
- Matches: `day1_exercise_tidy.ipynb`, `day2_exercise_joins.ipynb`, etc.
- Excludes: solution files (those end in `_solution.ipynb`)

### Assignment Notebooks (if they exist)
**Pattern:** `assignments/hw*/hw*_starter.ipynb`
- Matches: `assignments/hw1/hw1_starter.ipynb`, `assignments/hw2/hw2_starter.ipynb`, etc.
- Excludes: solution files

**Verification Strategy:**
1. First, use Glob with pattern `notebooks/day*_block_*.ipynb` to find all teaching notebooks
2. Then, use Glob with pattern `notebooks/day*_exercise_*.ipynb` to find exercise notebooks
3. Finally, use Glob with pattern `assignments/hw*/hw*_starter.ipynb` to find assignments
4. Launch parallel verification agents for ALL discovered notebooks

## Output Format

For each notebook, produce a report:

```markdown
## Cell-by-Cell Verification Report: [notebook_name]

### Cell [N]: [Brief description]
**Markdown says:** [What the markdown promises]  
**Code does:** [What the code actually does]  
**Output shows:** [What appears in the output]  
**Status:** ‚úÖ MATCH / ‚ö†Ô∏è MISMATCH / ‚ùå ERROR
**Issue (if any):** [Describe discrepancy]

[Repeat for EVERY code cell]

---

## Summary

**Total cells checked:** [N]  
**Cells with perfect match:** [N]  
**Cells with issues:** [N]

### Issues Found:
1. **[Severity] Cell [N]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Severity] Cell [N]**: [Brief description]

**Severity levels:**
- üü• CRITICAL: Empty results, wrong calculations, broken examples
- üü® MODERATE: Misleading labels, conceptual mismatches
- üü¶ MINOR: Terminology inconsistencies, wording issues
```

## Execution Workflow

0. **üö® EXECUTE ALL NOTEBOOKS FIRST (MANDATORY)**

   For EACH discovered notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace \
     path/to/notebook.ipynb \
     --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=300
   ```

   - If execution fails, document which cells errored
   - Note: Exercise notebooks with TODO cells may fail - that's expected
   - For exercise notebooks, verify only setup cells execute
   - **DO NOT PROCEED to agent launch until teaching notebooks execute successfully**

1. **Identify notebooks to verify**
   - If user specified paths, use those
   - Otherwise, use Glob tool to auto-discover:
     - `notebooks/day*_block_*.ipynb` (teaching notebooks)
     - `notebooks/day*_exercise_*.ipynb` (exercise notebooks)
     - `assignments/hw*/hw*_starter.ipynb` (assignment notebooks)
   - This ensures NEW notebooks are automatically included (Day 2, Day 3, etc.)

2. **Launch parallel agents** (one per notebook) **AFTER EXECUTION**
   ```
   Use Task tool with subagent_type='general-purpose'
   One task per notebook for maximum speed
   Tell agents notebooks are ALREADY EXECUTED
   ```

3. **Wait for all reports** to complete

4. **Synthesize findings**
   - Total cells verified across all notebooks
   - Total issues found
   - Breakdown by severity
   - Breakdown by issue type (empty results, mismatches, terminology, etc.)
   - **Report execution results** - which notebooks ran successfully

5. **Ask user** if they want issues fixed
   - If YES: Fix all issues using NotebookEdit
   - Re-execute notebooks with jupyter nbconvert
   - Verify fixes work
   - Show before/after for each fix

6. **Offer to commit** changes if fixes were made
   - Generate comprehensive commit message
   - Include issue counts and verification stats
   - Include execution confirmation
   - Push to GitHub if approved

## Example Usage

### Verify All Notebooks
```
/verify-notebooks
```

### Verify Specific Notebook
```
/verify-notebooks notebooks/day1_block_b_02_aggregations.ipynb
```

### Verify and Auto-Fix
```
/verify-notebooks --fix
```

---

## Critical Reminders

### Data Constraints
ALWAYS check actual data constraints before validating queries:
```python
con.execute("SELECT MAX(price) FROM data").df()  # Don't assume max price!
con.execute("SELECT DISTINCT item FROM data").df()  # Check what items exist!
```

### Empty Results = Red Flag
If ANY teaching example returns empty results (0 rows), this is **CRITICAL**:
- Students will think they made a mistake
- Teaching point is lost
- Must be fixed immediately

### Markdown Must Match Code EXACTLY
- If markdown says "first 5 rows", code must use LIMIT 5
- If markdown says "Coffee sales", code must filter Item = 'Coffee'
- If markdown says "revenue", code must calculate price √ó quantity
- Be pedantic - exact matches only!

---

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded when:

‚úÖ **EXECUTED every notebook with `jupyter nbconvert --execute`** (MOST IMPORTANT)
‚úÖ **VERIFIED all notebooks run without errors** (checked exit codes)
‚úÖ **INSPECTED actual outputs from execution** (not theoretical - REAL data)
‚úÖ Every code cell in every notebook has been verified against ACTUAL outputs
‚úÖ Markdown descriptions match code behavior exactly
‚úÖ All outputs are meaningful (no confusing empty results)
‚úÖ All issues documented with severity levels
‚úÖ Fixes applied (if requested) and verified working
‚úÖ Teaching quality is production-ready

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è IF YOU DID NOT EXECUTE NOTEBOOKS, YOU FAILED THE VERIFICATION. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Reading code is not verification. Thinking about what code might do is not verification.
**EXECUTION IS VERIFICATION.**

---

**Remember:** This is about **teaching quality**. Students trust that examples work. Every empty result or mismatch erodes that trust. Be thorough, be pedantic, be rigorous.

**And EXECUTE FIRST.**
