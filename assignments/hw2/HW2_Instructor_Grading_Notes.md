## 🚨 Common Issues to Watch For

### 1. **Generic Copy-Paste Responses**
Students might use the same template for all communications. Look for:
- Identical structure across all sections
- No specific references to the analysis
- Generic business language without data

**Grading:** Maximum C-level if detected

### 2. **Wrong Audience Focus**
- Giving CEOs SQL details
- Giving engineers business strategy
- Not adapting tone/content

**Grading:** -0.5 points per occurrence

### 3. **No Quantification**
Using vague terms like "many," "several," "good," "bad" instead of specific numbers.

**Grading:** -0.5 points per section

### 4. **Missing Business Context**
Pure technical reporting without business implications.

**Grading:** -0.5 to -1 point depending on severity

### 5. **No Actionable Recommendations**
Just describing what they found without saying what to do about it.

**Grading:** -0.5 points per section

## 📈 Quick Grading Checklist

For each communication section, ask:

- [ ] **Specific?** Are there numbers, not generalizations?
- [ ] **Actionable?** Is there a clear next step?
- [ ] **Appropriate?** Is it written for the right audience?
- [ ] **Valuable?** Does it add business insight?
- [ ] **Professional?** Is it well-written and clear?

**Scoring guide:**
- 5/5 checks = A-level (90-100%)
- 4/5 checks = B-level (80-89%)
- 3/5 checks = C-level (70-79%)
- <3 checks = Below C

## 💡 Positive Feedback Examples

When students excel, acknowledge:

**Great specificity:**
"Excellent use of specific metrics (100% completeness, $800K savings) - this builds stakeholder confidence."

**Strong audience adaptation:**
"Perfect audience focus - your CEO summary focuses on strategy while your engineering brief provides technical specs."

**Valuable insights:**
"Great unexpected insight about furniture engagement - this kind of finding drives real business value."

**Clear recommendations:**
"Your recommendation to accelerate by 2 weeks with specific reasoning shows strong business judgment."

---

## 📝 Constructive Feedback Examples

When improvements needed:

**Too vague:**
"Your assessment mentions 'good quality' - quantify this. How many missing values? What % complete? Specifics build credibility."

**Wrong audience:**
"Your CEO brief includes SQL details they won't care about. Focus on strategic implications instead."

**No action:**
"You've identified that vehicle category underperforms, but what should we DO about it? Add a specific recommendation."

**Missing context:**
"You state '582 reviews' - is this good or bad? Compare to benchmarks or other acquisitions for context."

## 🔑 Key Takeaway for Grading

The new communication requirements transform this from a technical exercise into a professional data analyst simulation. Students who excel will:

1. Complete the technical work correctly
2. Communicate findings appropriately for each audience
3. Provide actionable business recommendations
4. Demonstrate they understand the business context

This better prepares them for real-world analyst roles where communication is as important as technical skills.
