## The Three Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-Commerce Analytics (Easiest)
- **Domain:** Online marketplace (similar to course materials)
- **Tables:** customers, orders, order_items, products
- **Focus:** Basic JOINs, aggregation, LEFT JOIN anti-pattern
- **Recommend for:** Students who want familiar territory

### Scenario 2: SaaS Product Analytics (Medium)
- **Domain:** B2B SaaS subscription business
- **Tables:** users, subscriptions, feature_usage, support_tickets
- **Focus:** Date arithmetic, subscription logic, window functions
- **Recommend for:** Students who want to stretch

### Scenario 3: Retail Store Operations (Medium)
- **Domain:** Multi-location retail chain
- **Tables:** stores, employees, transactions, inventory
- **Focus:** Multi-table JOINs, HAVING vs WHERE, inventory gap analysis
- **Recommend for:** Students interested in operations/retail

**All three test the same core concepts from Day 1-2.** Choice is about domain interest, not difficulty (though Scenario 1 is most similar to class).

## Interview Structure (25 minutes)

Each interview follows the same pattern:

| Time | Activity | What You're Testing |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 0-2 min | Welcome, scenario setup | Setting expectations |
| 2-7 min | Question 1 (Warm-up) | Basic SELECT, WHERE, filtering |
| 7-13 min | Question 2 (Core skills) | JOINs + aggregation |
| 13-19 min | Question 3 (Advanced) | Complex JOINs, anti-patterns, date logic |
| 19-24 min | Question 4 (Data thinking) | NULL awareness, business logic, discussion |
| 24-25 min | Wrap-up, feedback | Encouragement, 1-2 areas to improve |

**Timing is tight!** Use a timer or clock. Don't let Question 1 drag‚Äînudge students if needed.

## Tips for Interviewers

### Before the Interview

1. **Load the data** (takes 2 minutes):
```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:')
con.execute("CREATE TABLE customers AS SELECT * FROM 'scenario_X/data/customers.csv'")
# ... (see interviewer guide for full setup)
```

2. **Have the guide open** on your laptop for reference
3. **Clear the whiteboard** and have markers ready
4. **Set a timer** for 25 minutes

### During the Interview

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Be encouraging and supportive
- ‚úÖ Give hints if they're stuck (but not too many!)
- ‚úÖ Ask probing questions to dig deeper
- ‚úÖ Focus on their thinking process, not just correct answers
- ‚úÖ Take brief notes (for feedback)

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Give away answers
- ‚ùå Let students feel like they're failing
- ‚ùå Skip questions (even if running late, try to touch on all 4)
- ‚ùå Be overly critical
- ‚ùå Compare students to each other

### Giving Feedback

**Structure** (2 minutes):
1. **Positive:** "Your [X] was really strong, especially..."
2. **Improve:** "One area to practice: [Y]. Specifically, [Z]."
3. **Encouragement:** "You're [ready / on the right track / building good skills]. Keep practicing!"

**Examples:**

*Strong student:*
> "Great work! Your understanding of JOINs was solid, and I loved how you asked about NULL values before writing the query. One thing to keep refining: when you're grouping, double-check that every SELECT column is either in GROUP BY or an aggregate. Overall, you're interview-ready!"

*Struggling student:*
> "You've got the fundamentals down, which is awesome. I'd recommend practicing JOINs a bit more, especially understanding when to use INNER vs LEFT. Your data thinking in Question 4 showed good business sense. Keep practicing these patterns and you'll be ready!"

**Always end positively!** Even if they struggled, they came to practice‚Äîthat's huge.

## Common Student Mistakes (What to Watch For)

### The Big Three (Instant Red Flags)
1. **= NULL instead of IS NULL** ‚Üê #1 killer!
2. **Aggregates in WHERE instead of HAVING**
3. **Wrong JOIN type** (INNER when they need LEFT)

### Other Common Mistakes
- Forgetting GROUP BY columns
- Missing COUNT(DISTINCT) after JOINs
- Silent (not talking through approach)
- Rushing (not asking clarifying questions)

**When you see these:** Probe with questions, don't just correct. Example:
- "How do you check for NULL values in SQL?"
- "What's the difference between WHERE and HAVING?"
- "What happens when you use INNER JOIN here?"

---

## Logistics

### Room Setup
- **Whiteboard** (essential!)
- **Markers** (2-3, test them first)
- **Your laptop** with data loaded
- **Interviewer guide** open
- **Timer** or visible clock
- **Quiet space** (minimize interruptions)

### Scheduling
- **25 min per interview**
- **5 min buffer** between interviews (bathroom, reset whiteboard, mental break)
- **Reasonable daily limit:** 4-6 interviews (you'll be mentally exhausted after more!)
- **Best times:** Mornings (students are fresh)

### If Student is Late
- Wait 5 minutes
- If no-show, mark as canceled and take a break
- Email student afterward to check in

### If Student is Early
- Great! But don't start early (respect your schedule)
- They can review notes in the hallway/waiting area

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if a student can't answer any questions?

**A:** This is practice! Use it as a teaching moment:
- Walk them through Question 1 step-by-step
- Point them to specific resources (Day 1 notebooks, SQL reference)
- Encourage them to come to office hours before trying again
- Frame it positively: "Now you know what to work on!"

### Q: What if a student finishes all 4 questions in 15 minutes?

**A:** Great! You have bonus questions:
- "How would you optimize this query?"
- "What would happen if [edge case]?"
- "Rewrite this query using a CTE"
- "What indexes would help this query run faster?" (if they know indexes)

Or just give them detailed feedback and let them go early.

### Q: Can students do multiple scenarios?

**A:** Only if:
- Everyone who wants one slot has gotten one
- You have capacity
- They want extra practice (not trying to "game" the system)

First priority: Everyone gets one opportunity.

### Q: What if I need to cancel a day of interviews?

**A:**
- Update the Google Sheet immediately
- Email affected students ASAP
- Offer alternative dates
- Apologize (stuff happens!)

### Q: Should I share the interviewer guides with students?

**A:** No! That defeats the purpose. They should prepare using:
- Course materials (Day 1-2 notebooks)
- Student prep guide
- Practice problems

The questions should be somewhat surprising (but fair).

## Advanced: Customizing Scenarios

If you want to create your own scenarios or modify existing ones:

### Keep These Elements
1. **4 questions** with clear progression (easy ‚Üí hard)
2. **Business context** (not just abstract SQL)
3. **Real data** with intentional messiness (NULLs, edge cases)
4. **Data thinking question** (#4 should be discussion-based)

### Modify These Based on Your Course
- Table schemas (match your teaching datasets)
- Specific SQL features (if you taught CTEs, include them)
- Business domain (use what's relevant to your students)

### Don't Change
- **25-minute format** (industry standard)
- **Whiteboard requirement** (key skill to practice)
- **4-question structure** (proven progression)
- **Scoring dimensions** (technical, best practices, communication, thinking)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Running over time

**Solution:**
- Set a timer and stick to it
- If Student 1 struggles, don't skip Question 4‚Äîjust ask it faster
- Practice saying, "We're running low on time, let me give you a hint..."

### Problem: Student is too nervous to think

**Solution:**
- Pause, smile, reassure: "This is practice. Take a breath."
- Ask easier warm-up: "What tables do we have? What columns?"
- Give explicit hint to get them started

### Problem: Student is overconfident and makes mistakes

**Solution:**
- Let them finish their query
- Ask: "Walk me through what this query returns."
- Probe gently: "What if customer_id is NULL?"
- They'll often self-correct when explaining

### Problem: You're exhausted after 4 interviews

**Solution:**
- This is normal! It's mentally taxing.
- Take real breaks between interviews (walk, coffee, snack)
- Don't schedule more than 6 per day
- Spread interviews across multiple days if possible

---

## Data Files

Each scenario includes sample CSV files in `/data/`:

**Characteristics:**
- Small (~20-100 rows total across all tables)
- Realistic IDs (hashes, not sequential numbers)
- Intentional NULLs (~10% where appropriate)
- Edge cases (stores with no transactions, etc.)
- Representative of real business data

**You can modify these!** Just:
- Keep the same column names (or update the interviewer guide)
- Maintain the key relationships (PKs/FKs)
- Include intentional edge cases for students to discover
