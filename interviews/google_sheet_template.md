5. Optional: Set up **conditional formatting**:

**Tips:**
- Schedule 25-minute slots with 5-minute buffer between (e.g., 9:00-9:25, 9:30-9:55)

If a student doesn't show up:
1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Mark Status as "Canceled"
3. Add note: "No-show [date]"
4. Email student to check in

May 7, 2024	9:30-9:55 AM	[Dropdown]			Available
...
```

**Scheduling Tips:**
- **Morning slots** (9-12): Students are fresh, perform better
- **Lunch break** (12-1): Essential for you!
- **Afternoon slots** (1-4): Good, but students may be tired
- **Late afternoon** (4+): Avoid if possible (low energy)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Students are overbooking

**Solution:** Add data validation to Column D (Student Name):
- Custom formula: `=COUNTIF(D:D, D2) <= 1`
- This prevents duplicate names

### Problem: Students are editing others' bookings

**Solution:**
1. Make a copy of the sheet at the end of each day as backup
2. Use Version History (File ‚Üí Version History) to restore if needed
3. Send a reminder email about not editing others' slots

### Problem: All slots are booked, more students want to participate

**Solution:**
1. Add more dates if your schedule allows
2. Or: Create a "Waitlist" tab in the same sheet
3. Or: Offer a second round after all initial bookings are complete

---

## Analytics (Optional)

You can track some interesting metrics:

1. **Scenario popularity:**
   ```
   =COUNTIF(C:C, "Scenario 1: E-Commerce Analytics")
   ```

2. **Completion rate:**
   ```
   =COUNTIF(F:F, "Completed") / COUNTIF(F:F, "Booked")
   ```

3. **No-show rate:**
   ```
   =COUNTIF(F:F, "Canceled") / (COUNTIF(F:F, "Booked") + COUNTIF(F:F, "Canceled"))
   ```

---
