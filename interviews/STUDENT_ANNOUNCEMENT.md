# SQL Whiteboard Interview Simulations - ECBS5294

**IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Optional Practice Opportunity**

---

## What is This?

I'm offering **optional 1-on-1 SQL whiteboard interview simulations** to help you prepare for real technical interviews at companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and other tech/data companies.

This is modeled directly on how companies like Meta conduct their SQL technical screens. You'll get:
- **25 minutes** of realistic interview experience
- **A whiteboard** (no laptop!)
- **4 SQL questions** progressing from basic to advanced
- **Real-time feedback** on your approach and thinking
- **Experience** with interview pressure (in a safe environment)

---

## Why Should I Do This?

### 1. **This is how real interviews work**
When you interview for Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, or Data Scientist roles at FAANG companies, you WILL face whiteboard SQL questions. This is your chance to practice in a low-stakes environment.

### 2. **It's harder than you think**
Writing SQL without a computer, while talking out loud, with someone watching, is different from homework. You need to practice this skill.

### 3. **You'll get personalized feedback**
I'll tell you exactly what you did well and what to improve. You'll know your SQL readiness level before real interviews.

### 4. **It builds confidence**
The first time you do a whiteboard interview should NOT be at your dream company. Do it here, fail safely, learn, and be ready when it counts.

## What to Expect

### You Will:
- Show up with **just a marker** (no laptop, no notes, no phone)
- Receive a business scenario (e.g., "You're interviewing at an e-commerce company...")
- See table schemas drawn on the whiteboard
- Answer 4 SQL questions of increasing difficulty
- **Talk through your thinking out loud** (this is critical!)
- Ask clarifying questions (encouraged!)
- Write SQL on the whiteboard

### I Will:
- Play the role of interviewer (I'll be professional but friendly)
- Describe the scenario and draw schemas
- Ask questions at the appropriate difficulty level
- Give hints if you get stuck (but not too many!)
- Evaluate your SQL, your communication, and your data thinking
- Provide feedback at the end

### This is NOT:
- ‚ùå Graded (this is 100% optional practice)
- ‚ùå Part of your course grade
- ‚ùå A "gotcha" session
- ‚ùå Meant to stress you out (okay, maybe a little - but that's the point!)

### This IS:
- ‚úÖ Realistic practice
- ‚úÖ A learning opportunity
- ‚úÖ Personalized feedback
- ‚úÖ Preparation for real interviews
- ‚úÖ Optional (but highly recommended!)

## Which Scenario Will I Get?

There are **3 scenarios** to choose from when you book:
1. **E-Commerce Analytics** - Most similar to class materials (orders, customers, products)
2. **SaaS Product Analytics** - Subscription business model (users, subscriptions, feature usage)
3. **Retail Store Operations** - Multi-location retail chain (stores, transactions, inventory)

**Pick the one you're most interested in.** All three test the same core SQL skills from Day 1-2 of class.

**Note:** I won't tell you the specific questions in advance (that defeats the purpose!), but they align with what we've covered:
- SELECT, WHERE, filtering
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
- GROUP BY, aggregations
- Window functions
- NULL handling
- Date calculations
- Business/data thinking

---

## How to Prepare

### 1. **Review Day 1 and Day 2 Materials**
- Day 1, Block B: SQL Foundations, Aggregations, Window Functions
- Day 2, Block A: JOINs

### 2. **Read the Student Prep Guide**
See `student_prep_guide.md` in the `/interviews` folder (or on Moodle) for:
- Key concepts to review
- Whiteboard tips
- Common mistakes to avoid
- How you'll be evaluated

### 3. **Practice Writing SQL by Hand**
Seriously! Grab a piece of paper and write out SQL queries without a computer. You'll realize how much you rely on autocomplete and error messages.

### 4. **Practice Talking Out Loud**
When you write SQL, narrate your thinking: "First, I need to join these two tables... I'll use INNER JOIN because I only want matches... Now I'll filter for..."

This feels weird at first, but it's essential in interviews.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this mandatory?**
A: No, it's 100% optional. But if you plan to interview for data roles, I STRONGLY recommend it.

**Q: Will this help my grade?**
A: Not directly, but it will make you better at SQL, which will help on homework and exams.

**Q: What if I freeze up and can't answer?**
A: That's okay! This is practice. I'll give you hints and we'll work through it. The goal is to learn.

**Q: Can I bring notes?**
A: No. Real interviews don't allow notes, so neither will this.

**Q: Can I do this multiple times?**
A: Only if there are open slots after everyone has had a chance. Sign up for one scenario first.

**Q: What if I'm not good at SQL yet?**
A: This is FOR people who aren't confident yet! You'll learn more from struggling through this than from avoiding it.

**Q: Will you judge me if I mess up?**
A: Absolutely not. I'll be supportive and constructive. This is a safe space to make mistakes and learn.

**Q: What should I wear?**
A: Whatever you're comfortable in. This isn't a real job interview‚Äîit's practice.

## What Happens After?

### Immediate Feedback (2 minutes)
Right after the interview, I'll give you:
- What you did well
- 1-2 specific areas to improve
- Your overall readiness level

### Optional Follow-Up
If you want more detailed feedback, come to office hours and we can review your performance.

## Bottom Line

**This is one of the most valuable experiences you can have in this course.**

Most students never get to practice whiteboard interviews before their first real one. You're getting that chance now. Take it!

Even if you feel unprepared, **do it anyway**. The experience alone is worth it.

## Good Luck!

Remember: The goal isn't to be perfect. The goal is to **learn, practice, and improve**.

I'm excited to see you work through these scenarios. You've learned a LOT in this class‚Äîthis is your chance to demonstrate it under pressure.

See you at the whiteboard! üìùüéØ
