# Solution Management System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive solution management system for ECBS5294 that prevents accidental commits of unencrypted solution files while providing a clean workflow for distributing solutions to students.

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-07

## What Was Built

### 1. Encryption/Decryption Scripts

#### `scripts/encrypt_solutions.py` (188 lines)
- Creates password-protected ZIP files using system `zip -P` command
- Validates solution file naming conventions
- Verifies ZIP encryption after creation
- Logs all encryption events to `.encryption_log.txt`
- Provides clear next-step instructions

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/encrypt_solutions.py \
  notebooks/day1_exercise_tidy_solution.ipynb \
  --password "secure-password" \
  --day 1 \
  --block A
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Automatic output naming: `solutions/solutions-day{N}-block{X}.zip`
- ✅ Custom output paths supported with `--output` flag
- ✅ Verification that ZIP is actually password-protected
- ✅ Prevents overwriting without confirmation
- ✅ Warning for non-standard file names

#### `scripts/decrypt_solution.py` (107 lines)
- Extracts password-protected solution ZIPs
- Interactive password prompt or command-line password
- Extracts to `solutions/decrypted/` by default
- Shows file sizes and extraction summary

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/decrypt_solution.py solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip --password "pwd"
# OR interactive:
python scripts/decrypt_solution.py solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip
```

#### `scripts/list_solutions.py` (129 lines)
- Comprehensive status checker for all solutions
- Shows encrypted solutions (safe to commit)
- Warns about unencrypted solutions (DO NOT COMMIT)
- Displays encryption log history
- Provides actionable guidance

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/list_solutions.py
```

**Output**:
- 📦 Encrypted Solutions: Count and file sizes
- ⚠️ Unencrypted Solutions: Warnings with file locations
- 📝 Encryption Log: Recent encryption history

### 2. Git Pre-Commit Hook

#### `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (132 lines)
Automated enforcement that runs on every `git commit`:

**Blocks**:
- Any file matching `*_solution.ipynb`
- Any file matching `*_solution.py`
- Any file with "solution" in path (case-insensitive) except ZIPs

**Allows**:
- Encrypted ZIP files in `solutions/` directory
- BUT verifies they're actually password-protected

**Verification Method**:
- Attempts to `unzip -t` without password
- If it succeeds → ZIP is NOT encrypted → BLOCK
- If it fails → ZIP is encrypted → ALLOW

**Error Messages**:
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Shows exactly which files are blocked
- Provides fix commands with examples
- Color-coded output (red for errors, green for success)

#### `scripts/setup_hooks.sh` (52 lines)
One-command installer for git hooks:

```bash
./scripts/setup_hooks.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Verifies you're in a git repository
- Checks that pre-commit hook exists
- Makes hook executable with `chmod +x`
- Provides usage documentation and test instructions

### 3. Documentation Files

#### `solutions/README.md` (Student-facing)
Comprehensive guide for students including:
- Why solutions are encrypted
- File naming conventions
- How to decrypt solutions
- Learning tips (before/during/after reviewing solutions)
- Academic integrity guidelines

#### `solutions/INSTRUCTOR.md` (Instructor workflow)
Detailed instructor/TA guide covering:
- Complete workflow from creation to release
- Script usage with examples
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Collaboration with TAs
- Semester maintenance checklist

#### `solutions/PASSWORDS.md` (Password tracking template)
- Template for documenting passwords
- **Gitignored** - never committed
- Includes guidelines for strong passwords
- Release tracking table

### 4. Security Configuration

#### `.gitignore` (Updated)
Added comprehensive patterns:
```
# Solution files - must be encrypted
*_solution.ipynb
*_solution.py
*/solution.ipynb
*/solution.py

# Solution management
solutions/PASSWORDS.md
solutions/decrypted/
solutions/.encryption_log.txt
```

**Provides defense in depth**:
1. Files are gitignored (can't accidentally add)
2. If force-added with `-f`, pre-commit hook blocks
3. Both layers work together for security

#### `CLAUDE.md` (Updated)
Added comprehensive "Solution File Management" section:
- File naming conventions
- Encryption workflow
- Git pre-commit hook documentation
- Security rules (NEVER/ALWAYS lists)
- Available scripts
- Student-facing approach

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

### ✅ Test 1: Encryption
```bash
python scripts/encrypt_solutions.py \
  solutions/decrypted/day1_exercise_tidy_solution.ipynb \
  --password "test-password-123" \
  --day 1 \
  --block A
```
**Result**: Created `solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip` (6.9 KB)

### ✅ Test 2: Encryption Verification
ZIP file verified as password-protected immediately after creation.

### ✅ Test 3: Status Checker
```bash
python scripts/list_solutions.py
```
**Result**:
- Found 1 encrypted solution (safe)
- Found 2 unencrypted files (in gitignored locations)
- Showed encryption log with 1 entry

### ✅ Test 4: Decryption
```bash
python scripts/decrypt_solution.py \
  solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip \
  --password "test-password-123"
```
**Result**: Successfully extracted to `solutions/decrypted/`

### ✅ Test 5: Git Hook - Allow Encrypted
```bash
git add solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip
git commit -m "Add encrypted solutions"
```
**Result**: Commit allowed. Hook verified ZIP is password-protected.

### ✅ Test 6: Git Hook - Block Unencrypted
```bash
echo "# Test" > test_solution.ipynb
git add -f test_solution.ipynb
git commit -m "Should be blocked"
```
**Result**: Commit blocked with clear error message and fix instructions.

### ✅ Test 7: .gitignore Protection
Attempting to add `test_solution.ipynb` without force flag:
**Result**: Git refused to add (ignored by .gitignore)

## Security Features

### Defense in Depth (3 Layers)

1. **Gitignore Protection**: Files matching `*_solution.*` cannot be added
2. **Pre-commit Hook**: If force-added, hook blocks the commit
3. **Documentation**: Clear guidance in CLAUDE.md and instructor docs

### Password Protection

- Uses system `zip -P` command for strong encryption
- Verifies encryption by attempting passwordless extraction
- Password tracking in gitignored `PASSWORDS.md`
- Never commits passwords to repository

### Student Access Model

**"Early Access, Late Unlock"**:
- Students get encrypted ZIPs from day one
- Passwords released only after due dates
- Reduces anxiety about "losing" solutions
- Encourages attempting problems first

## Workflow Summary

### For Instructors/TAs

**Creating and Committing Solutions**:

1. Write solution: `notebooks/day1_exercise_tidy_solution.ipynb`
2. Encrypt: `python scripts/encrypt_solutions.py <file> --password <pwd> --day 1 --block A`
3. Check status: `python scripts/list_solutions.py`
4. Commit: `git add solutions/solutions-day1-blockA.zip && git commit -m "Add encrypted solutions"`
5. Document password in `solutions/PASSWORDS.md` (not committed)

**Releasing Solutions**:

1. Wait for assignment due date
2. Announce password in Canvas
3. Optionally update course documentation

### For Students

**Accessing Solutions**:

1. Clone repository (encrypted ZIPs already available)
2. Wait for password release announcement
3. Decrypt: `python scripts/decrypt_solution.py <zip> --password <pwd>`
4. Review and learn from solutions

## Maintenance

### Beginning of Semester
- [ ] Run `./scripts/setup_hooks.sh` to install hooks
- [ ] Create `solutions/PASSWORDS.md` from template
- [ ] Test workflow with a dummy file

### During Semester
- [ ] Run `python scripts/list_solutions.py` weekly
- [ ] Ensure no unencrypted solutions in tracked files
- [ ] Keep `PASSWORDS.md` updated and backed up

### End of Semester
- [ ] Archive `PASSWORDS.md` securely for next year
- [ ] Review `.encryption_log.txt` for complete history
- [ ] Document any workflow improvements

## Known Behaviors

### False Positives in Status Checker

`scripts/list_solutions.py` flags any file with "solution" in the name:
- `scripts/decrypt_solution.py` shows as "unencrypted" (expected)
- This is intentional - conservative detection is safer
- Real solution files are in gitignored locations anyway

### Gitignore vs Hook

Both layers work together:
- Most users can't accidentally add solution files (gitignored)
- Force adds (`git add -f`) are caught by the hook
- Provides redundant safety

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:

✅ **No unencrypted solutions can be committed** - Enforced by hook and gitignore
✅ **Students get early access to encrypted files** - ZIPs committed to repo
✅ **Passwords released on schedule** - Documented in PASSWORDS.md (secure)
✅ **Clear, actionable error messages** - Hook provides fix instructions
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Student and instructor guides
✅ **Consistent file naming** - Enforced by encryption script
✅ **Automated verification** - Hook tests ZIP encryption
✅ **Complete audit trail** - `.encryption_log.txt` tracks all events

## Next Steps

The solution management system is complete and ready for use. Next actions:

1. **Instructor**: Review `solutions/INSTRUCTOR.md` for workflow details
2. **First commit**: The encrypted Day 1 Block A solution is already committed
3. **Document password**: Add password to `solutions/PASSWORDS.md`
4. **Back up passwords**: Keep `PASSWORDS.md` in secure location outside repo
5. **Continue course development**: Ready to create more solutions as needed

## Questions or Issues?
