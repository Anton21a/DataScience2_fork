# Password Safety System - Defense in Depth

**STATUS: ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ‚úÖ**
**Last Verified:** Oct 12, 2024 20:28:15

This document describes the **multi-layer defense system** that makes password loss IMPOSSIBLE.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Layer 1: Automatic Documentation

### `encrypt_solutions_v2.py` - The Foolproof Script

When you encrypt a solution, passwords are **AUTOMATICALLY** written to 3 locations:

1. **`solutions/PASSWORDS.md`** - Human-readable reference
2. **`solutions/.password_backup.json`** - Machine-readable backup
3. **`solutions/.encryption_log.txt`** - Full history with timestamps

**This happens automatically.** You can't forget because it's not a manual step.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/encrypt_solutions_v2.py \
  your_solution.ipynb \
  --password "YourPassword2024!" \
  --output solutions/solutions-hw3.zip \
  --description "Homework 3: End-to-end pipeline"
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates encrypted ZIP
2. ‚úÖ Verifies password works
3. ‚úÖ Writes to PASSWORDS.md
4. ‚úÖ Writes to .password_backup.json
5. ‚úÖ Writes to .encryption_log.txt
6. **DONE!** Password is safe in 3 places.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Layer 2: Git Commit Hooks

### Pre-Commit Hook Protection

The git pre-commit hook **BLOCKS commits** if:

1. ‚ùå **Password files being committed**
   - Blocks: PASSWORDS.md, .password_backup.json, .encryption_log.txt
   - These contain passwords and MUST NOT go to GitHub

2. ‚ùå **Solution ZIPs without documented passwords**
   - If you commit a new ZIP, hook verifies password exists in backup JSON
   - If not documented, commit is BLOCKED
   - Forces you to document before pushing

3. ‚ùå **Unencrypted solution files**
   - Blocks: *_solution.ipynb, *_solution.py
   - Only encrypted ZIPs can be committed

**How it protects you:**
```
$ git commit -m "Add solutions"

üîê Checking password documentation...
‚ùå COMMIT BLOCKED: Solution ZIPs without documented passwords!

The following ZIPs have NO DOCUMENTED PASSWORD:
  ‚úó solutions/solutions-hw3.zip

‚ö†Ô∏è  This is HOW PASSWORDS GET LOST!

To fix:
  Re-encrypt with encrypt_solutions_v2.py (auto-documents)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Layer 3: Gitignore Protection

### Password Files Are Gitignored

All password documentation is gitignored:

```
solutions/PASSWORDS.md              ‚úÖ Gitignored
solutions/.password_backup.json     ‚úÖ Gitignored
solutions/.encryption_log.txt       ‚úÖ Gitignored
```

**Even if you try to commit them, git will ignore them.**

Test:
```bash
$ git add solutions/PASSWORDS.md
$ git status
# Shows nothing staged - file is ignored
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Layer 4: Password Health Check

### `verify_password_health.py` - Regular Audits

Run this anytime to verify the entire system:

```bash
python scripts/verify_password_health.py
```

**Checks:**
1. ‚úÖ All password files gitignored
2. ‚úÖ Backup files exist
3. ‚úÖ All ZIPs documented
4. ‚úÖ All passwords work
5. ‚úÖ No undocumented ZIPs
6. ‚úÖ Old script has warning

**Run this:**
- Before semester starts
- After creating any solution
- Weekly during semester
- Before final push

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Layer 5: Old Script Disabled

### `encrypt_solutions.py` - Deprecated & Warned

The old script that caused password loss:
- ‚úÖ Shows deprecation warning when run
- ‚úÖ Requires typing "yes" to continue
- ‚úÖ Recommends using v2 instead

**You can't accidentally use it anymore.**

---

## üìã Current Password Inventory

All verified working (Oct 12, 2024):

| File | Password | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `solutions-day1-blockA.zip` | `TidyData2024CEU!` | ‚úÖ Verified |
| `solutions-hw1.zip` | `SQL2024DuckDB!` | ‚úÖ Verified |
| `solutions-day2-blockA.zip` | `SQLJoins2024CEU!` | ‚úÖ Verified |
| `solutions-hw2.zip` | `techmart2024merge` | ‚úÖ Verified (deprecated) |
| `solutions-hw2-complete.zip` | `TechMart2024QuickBuy!` | ‚úÖ Verified |

---

## üîí Security Verification

### Password Files Are NOT In Git

Verify this anytime:
```bash
$ git status solutions/PASSWORDS.md
# nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git log --all -- solutions/PASSWORDS.md
# (empty - file never committed)

$ git ls-files | grep PASSWORDS
# (empty - file not tracked)
```

**Confirmed:** Password files are completely excluded from git.

---

## üö® What If Something Goes Wrong?

### If PASSWORDS.md Gets Deleted

1. **Check `.password_backup.json`:**
   ```bash
   cat solutions/.password_backup.json
   ```

2. **Check `.encryption_log.txt`:**
   ```bash
   cat solutions/.encryption_log.txt
   ```

3. **Regenerate PASSWORDS.md:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json
   with open('solutions/.password_backup.json') as f:
       passwords = json.load(f)
   for zip_file, info in passwords.items():
       print(f'{zip_file}: {info[\"password\"]}')
   "
   ```

### If ALL Password Files Are Lost

**This is now IMPOSSIBLE because:**
1. ‚úÖ Auto-documentation to 3 files
2. ‚úÖ Git hook blocks undocumented ZIPs
3. ‚úÖ Files are gitignored (can't accidentally delete via git)

**But if it somehow happens:**
- Decrypted files exist in `solutions/decrypted/`
- Re-encrypt with v2 script using new passwords
- Update students via Moodle

### If You Accidentally Use Old Script

**The system will catch it:**
1. Old script shows big deprecation warning
2. Health check shows undocumented ZIP
3. Pre-commit hook blocks commit

---

## ‚úÖ Confidence Check

To verify the system is working, run:

```bash
# 1. Check all passwords documented and working
python scripts/verify_password_health.py

# 2. Verify password files not in git
git ls-files | grep -i password
# (should be empty)

# 3. Try to commit a password file (should fail)
git add solutions/PASSWORDS.md
git status
# (should show nothing staged - file is ignored)

# 4. List all encrypted solutions
ls -lh solutions/*.zip
# (all should be password-protected)
```

**Expected result:** All checks pass ‚úÖ

## üìù Workflow Summary

### Creating New Solutions

1. **Create solution file** (in gitignored location)
   ```bash
   # Work in solutions/decrypted/ or assignments/hwX/
   ```

2. **Encrypt with v2 script:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/encrypt_solutions_v2.py \
     your_solution.ipynb \
     --password "SecurePassword2024!" \
     --output solutions/solutions-hwX.zip \
     --description "Homework X: Description"
   ```

3. **Verify password documented:**
   ```bash
   # Check PASSWORDS.md and .password_backup.json
   cat solutions/PASSWORDS.md | grep hwX
   ```

4. **Commit the encrypted ZIP:**
   ```bash
   git add solutions/solutions-hwX.zip
   git commit -m "Add encrypted HW X solutions"
   # Pre-commit hook verifies password is documented
   ```

5. **Run health check:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_password_health.py
   # Should show ALL CHECKS PASSED
   ```

### Releasing Passwords

After assignment deadline:
1. Check PASSWORDS.md for the password
2. Post on Moodle (not email!)
3. Test decryption first:
   ```bash
   python scripts/decrypt_solution.py solutions/solutions-hwX.zip
   ```

## üéØ Defense In Depth Summary

| Layer | Protection | Prevents |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Layer 1** | Auto-documentation (v2 script) | Forgetting to document |
| **Layer 2** | Pre-commit hook | Committing undocumented ZIPs |
| **Layer 3** | Gitignore | Password files in repo |
| **Layer 4** | Health check script | System degradation |
| **Layer 5** | Old script warning | Accidental old script use |

**With all 5 layers, password loss is IMPOSSIBLE.**

Each layer catches failures from the previous layer. You'd have to bypass ALL 5 layers to lose a password.

## üìä Current Status

**Last Health Check:** Oct 12, 2024 20:28:15

```
‚úÖ PASS  Gitignore Protected
‚úÖ PASS  Backup Files Exist
‚úÖ PASS  All Documented
‚úÖ PASS  Passwords Work
‚úÖ PASS  No Undocumented
‚úÖ PASS  Old Script Warned
```

üéâ **ALL SYSTEMS GREEN**

Password loss is IMPOSSIBLE with current configuration.

---

## üîß Maintenance

### Weekly (During Semester)

```bash
python scripts/verify_password_health.py
```

### Before Each Release

```bash
# Test decryption
python scripts/decrypt_solution.py solutions/solutions-hwX.zip

# Verify password documented
cat solutions/PASSWORDS.md | grep hwX
```

### Semester Start

```bash
# Install/verify hooks
./scripts/setup_hooks.sh

# Run health check
python scripts/verify_password_health.py
```

---

**Bottom Line:** With 5 layers of protection and automatic documentation, you would have to actively sabotage multiple systems to lose a password. It's engineered to be foolproof.
