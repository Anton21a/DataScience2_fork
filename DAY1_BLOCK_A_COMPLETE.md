## 📖 How to Use These Materials

### Before Class

1. **Instructor prep:**
   - Read `references/teaching/day1_block_a_teacher_primer.md`
   - Review `notebooks/day1_block_a_tidy_foundations.ipynb`
   - Test environment with `notebooks/day1_setup_check.ipynb`

2. **Student prep (send ahead):**
   - Run `notebooks/day1_setup_check.ipynb` to verify environment
   - Install any missing packages

### During Class (90 minutes)

**First 60 minutes: Teaching**
- Open `notebooks/day1_block_a_tidy_foundations.ipynb`
- Work through sections 1-6 interactively
- Encourage questions, show examples live
- Refer to `references/teaching/day1_block_a_teacher_primer.md` for pacing

**Last 30 minutes: Exercise**
- Students open `notebooks/day1_exercise_tidy.ipynb`
- Work independently or in pairs
- Instructor circulates to help
- Starter notebook has 22 TODOs to guide them

### After Class

1. **Release solution:**
   - Share `notebooks/day1_exercise_tidy_solution.ipynb`

2. **Student reference:**
   - Point students to `references/tidy_data_checklist.md` for future work

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Pedagogical Approach
- **Concrete before abstract:** Show examples before stating rules
- **Build confidence:** Start with wins, normalize mistakes
- **Business relevance:** Every concept tied to business decisions
- **Interleaved practice:** 15-minute teaching segments with immediate examples

### Dataset Choice
- **Real messiness:** Kaggle dataset has authentic data quality issues
- **Manageable size:** 10K rows is large enough to be real, small enough to load quickly
- **Familiar domain:** Cafe transactions are intuitive for all students
- **Good structure:** Data is tidy (structure), just dirty (quality) - teaches the distinction

### Exercise Structure
- **Scaffolded, not blank:** Students fill in TODOs, not starting from scratch
- **Reflection prompts:** Forces thinking beyond code
- **Multiple validation points:** Catches errors early
- **Documentation emphasis:** Students explain choices throughout

### Assessment Philosophy
- **Not graded:** This is practice, build skills without pressure
- **Emphasis on thinking:** "Why?" matters more than "What?"
- **Multiple valid approaches:** Solution shows alternatives
- **Run-All standard:** Reproducibility from day one

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Day 1 Block A materials complete
- 🔲 Day 1 Block B materials (SQL with DuckDB)
- 🔲 Test Day 1 Block A with a student or colleague

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add slide deck for projection during teaching
- Create video walkthrough of teaching notebook
- Add more practice datasets (easier/harder variations)
- Create assessment rubric if this becomes graded

## 📝 Notes for Instructor

### What Students Struggle With
- **"What even is a primary key?"** → Show 5+ concrete examples before abstract definition
- **"Why does this matter?"** → Keep tying back to business decisions
- **Notebook state confusion** → Teach "Restart & Run All" in first 10 minutes
- **Perfectionism paralysis** → "Document assumptions and move forward"

### Time Management
- Sections 1-3 (tidy data): ~30 minutes
- Sections 4-6 (keys, types, missing): ~30 minutes
- Exercise setup + work: ~30 minutes
- Adjust based on student engagement

### Common Questions
- "Should I use Excel instead?" → Frame as expanding toolkit, not replacing
- "What if I make the wrong choice?" → Emphasize documented decisions over "correct" answers
- "Can I drop rows with missing data?" → Yes, if documented! Multiple approaches valid

## ✨ What Makes This Special

1. **Beginner-friendly:** Assumes zero prior knowledge, builds from ground up
2. **Business-focused:** Data structure as strategic, not just technical
3. **Real data:** Authentic messiness from Kaggle, not synthetic
4. **Well-scaffolded:** Students have clear path, not overwhelmed
5. **Multiple perspectives:** Teaching notebook + exercise + solution + reference card
6. **Complete package:** From setup check to final validation, everything included
7. **Reproducible:** "Restart & Run All" standard from day one
8. **Thoughtful pedagogy:** Informed by teaching absolute beginners
