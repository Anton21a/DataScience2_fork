    "> **\"When you connect tables, you're connecting different aspects of the business. Joins are how organizations answer complex questions.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Business Reality:**\n",
    "- Your data lives in **multiple tables**, not one giant spreadsheet\n",
    "- **Customers** place **orders**\n",
    "- **Orders** contain **products**\n",
    "- **Products** come from **sellers**\n",
    "- Customers leave **reviews** about orders\n",
    "\n",
    "**To answer business questions, you need to JOIN these tables together:**\n",
    "- \"Which products generate the most revenue?\" → Join orders + products\n",
    "- \"Which sellers have the best ratings?\" → Join sellers + reviews\n",
    "- \"What percentage of orders lack reviews?\" → Join orders + reviews (carefully!)\n",

    "- Makes queries readable\n",
    "- Easier to debug\n",
    "- Self-documenting\n",

    "-- Good\n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\n",
