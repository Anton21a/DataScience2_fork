For example, 'created' or 'invoiced' because in fact the customers haven't actually got the orders yet, that, in turn, means that they wouldn't be able to write a review on orders when these orders on the beginning stages.    \n",

    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- Join `order_items` → `sellers`\n",
    "- Calculate total revenue per seller\n",
    "- Rank sellers within each state (use ROW_NUMBER() window function from Day 1!)\n",
    "- Filter to top 3 per state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use a CTE for clean structure:\n",
    "1. First CTE: Calculate seller revenue\n",
    "2. Second CTE: Add ranking with ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY state ...) - this will assign ranks 1, 2, 3... to sellers within each state, ordered by revenue\n",
    "3. Main query: Filter WHERE rank <= 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The query includes `LIMIT 30` to show approximately the top 10 states (10 states × 3 sellers = 30 rows, though some states may have fewer sellers). This keeps output manageable for review. In a real analysis, you'd remove the LIMIT to see all states.\n",

    "Against the backdrop of ten thousands orders, there are only a tiny number of unreviewed orders: less than 800. Olist undertakes a great work on customer-feedback ecouragement. That is self-evidently a good sign that allows to obtain a true commentary on products and to highlight reasonable notices for further sales improvement. At the first pkace Paula should take a look at a potential expansion of some product categories: such as health and beauty / watches and gifts. These product categories produce a significant share of total revenue for the marketplace, being extremely high-demanded among customers. Maybe it'd be useful to pay attention at uneven distribution of seller's output: there are obvious discrepancies among sellers effectiveness in some states. That might be a potential hazard for the whole seller sentiment in a certain state, because it could play a role of demotivator for other sellers to advance their sales because of impossibility to reach the same high KPIs as a local seller-leader. The decision can come down to reconsidering the awards system.  \n",
