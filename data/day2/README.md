## Block A: Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist)

**Source:** Kaggle - Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist  
**URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce  
**License:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  
**Used in:** Day 2 Block A (SQL Joins and Multi-Table Queries)

---

## Dataset Description

This is a **real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset** containing 100,000 orders made at the Olist Store between 2016 and 2018. Olist is the largest department store marketplace in Brazil, connecting small businesses to customers through a single contract.

This dataset is perfect for teaching SQL joins because it contains **multiple interconnected tables** with clear primary key/foreign key relationships. Students will learn to combine data from customers, orders, products, sellers, payments, and reviews to answer business questions.

**Why this dataset?**
- ✅ Real business data from actual e-commerce marketplace
- ✅ Multiple tables with clear relationships (like production databases)
- ✅ Complex enough to teach all join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- ✅ Business-relevant questions: customer behavior, product performance, seller analysis
- ✅ Data quality issues to handle (nulls, missing relationships)

## Recommended Tables for Day 2 Teaching

**Start with these 4 core tables:**

1. **`olist_orders_dataset.csv`** - Central fact table
2. **`olist_customers_dataset.csv`** - Who placed orders?
3. **`olist_order_items_dataset.csv`** - What was ordered?
4. **`olist_products_dataset.csv`** - Product catalog

**Why these 4?**
- Clear primary key/foreign key relationships
- Teach INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (with actual examples), and FULL OUTER JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN taught conceptually (all products have orders, so no natural RIGHT JOIN examples)
- Answer real business questions
- Manageable size (combined ~250K rows)

**Add for advanced exercises:**
- `olist_sellers_dataset.csv` - Multi-table joins (orders → items → sellers)
- `olist_order_payments_dataset.csv` - Multiple payments per order
- `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` - Customer satisfaction analysis
- `product_category_name_translation.csv` - String joins

## Intentional Data Characteristics

### Good News (Clean Data)
- ✅ No duplicate primary keys
- ✅ Consistent data types
- ✅ Valid date ranges (2016-2018)
- ✅ Clear foreign key relationships

### Teaching Opportunities (Real-World Messiness)

**1. Unmatched Rows (Perfect for JOIN Teaching!)**
- ❓ **Do all products appear in order_items?** YES - All 32,951 products have been ordered at least once.
  - **Teaching implication:** No natural RIGHT JOIN examples (products without orders)
  - **How to teach RIGHT JOIN:** Demonstrate conceptually that `A RIGHT JOIN B` is equivalent to `B LEFT JOIN A` (just flip the tables)
  - **Industry note:** RIGHT JOIN is rarely used in practice; LEFT JOIN is the standard
- ❓ **Do all customers have orders?** YES (by design - customer_id created at order time)
- ❓ **Do all orders have reviews?** NO! 768 orders (0.8%) have no reviews.
  - **Use case:** Perfect for `LEFT JOIN` teaching - shows orders without matching reviews
  - **Query:** `orders LEFT JOIN reviews` will show all orders, with NULL review_score for unreviewed orders

**2. Null Values**
- `order_approved_at`: NULL if payment not approved yet
- `order_delivered_carrier_date`: NULL if not shipped
- `order_delivered_customer_date`: NULL if not delivered
- `product_category_name`: Some products have NULL categories
- `review_comment_title`, `review_comment_message`: Many reviews have no text (just score)

**3. One-to-Many Relationships**
- One order → Multiple items (avg ~1.13 items per order)
- One order → Multiple payments (some customers split payment)
- **Watch for duplicate rows!** Joining orders to order_items inflates row count.

**4. Data Quality Issues**
- Some `product_id` in order_items don't exist in products table (orphaned FKs)
- Some `seller_id` in order_items don't exist in sellers table
- **Pedagogical gold:** Students must decide how to handle with different join types

---

## Learning Objectives

By working with this dataset, students will practice:

### Block A: SQL Joins (Day 2 Focus)

**Core Concepts:**
1. **INNER JOIN** - Only matching rows from both tables
   - Example: Orders with products (only completed orders with valid products)
2. **LEFT JOIN** - All rows from left table + matches from right
   - Example: All orders, even those without reviews (768 orders have no reviews)
3. **RIGHT JOIN** - All rows from right table + matches from left
   - Taught conceptually: `A RIGHT JOIN B` = `B LEFT JOIN A` (flip the tables)
   - Note: This dataset has no natural RIGHT JOIN examples (all products have orders)
   - Industry note: RIGHT JOIN rarely used; LEFT JOIN is the standard pattern
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** - All rows from both tables
   - Example: Complete view of orders and reviews (including orphaned records)

**Key Skills:**
- Understanding primary keys and foreign keys
- Recognizing one-to-many relationships
- Handling unmatched rows appropriately
- Avoiding duplicate row inflation
- Aggregating after joins (GROUP BY on the right grain)

**Business Questions:**
- What are the top 10 best-selling products?
- Which customers have placed the most orders?
- Which sellers have the highest average review scores?
- What percentage of orders are delivered on time?
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?

## Sample DuckDB Queries

### Load Tables

```sql
-- Load orders
CREATE TABLE orders AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_orders_dataset.csv';

-- Load customers
CREATE TABLE customers AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_customers_dataset.csv';

-- Load order items
CREATE TABLE order_items AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_order_items_dataset.csv';

-- Load products
CREATE TABLE products AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_products_dataset.csv';

-- Verify row counts
SELECT 'orders' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM orders
UNION ALL
SELECT 'customers', COUNT(*) FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'order_items', COUNT(*) FROM order_items
UNION ALL
SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products;
```

### Example Joins

**1. INNER JOIN: Orders with customer details**
```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_purchase_timestamp,
    c.customer_city,
    c.customer_state
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LIMIT 10;
```

**2. LEFT JOIN: All orders, even those without reviews**
```sql
-- Load reviews first
CREATE TABLE reviews AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv';

-- Find orders without reviews
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_purchase_timestamp,
    r.review_score
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON o.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.review_id IS NULL;
```

**3. Aggregation after JOIN: Revenue by product category**
```sql
-- Join order_items → products → category translation
SELECT
    p.product_category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) as num_orders,
    SUM(oi.price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.price) as avg_item_price
FROM order_items oi
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.product_category_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.product_category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**4. Multi-table JOIN: Orders → Items → Products → Sellers**
```sql
-- Load sellers
CREATE TABLE sellers AS
SELECT * FROM 'data/day2/block_a/olist_sellers_dataset.csv';

-- Top sellers by number of items sold
SELECT
    s.seller_id,
    s.seller_city,
    s.seller_state,
    COUNT(*) as items_sold,
    SUM(oi.price) as total_sales
FROM order_items oi
INNER JOIN sellers s ON oi.seller_id = s.seller_id
GROUP BY s.seller_id, s.seller_city, s.seller_state
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Common Pitfalls & Teaching Notes

### 1. Row Count Explosion
**Problem:** Joining orders (99K rows) to order_items (112K rows) returns 112K rows, not 99K!

**Why:** One order can have multiple items (one-to-many relationship).

**Solution:** Always check row counts before/after joins. Aggregate at the correct grain.

```sql
-- ❌ Wrong: This counts orders multiple times if they have multiple items
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;
-- Returns 112,650 (number of items, not orders!)

-- ✅ Correct: Count distinct orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;
-- Returns 99,441 (actual number of orders)
```

### 2. Handling Unmatched Foreign Keys
**Problem:** Some `product_id` in order_items don't exist in products table.

**Decision points for students:**
- INNER JOIN: Exclude these rows (most conservative)
- LEFT JOIN: Keep order_items, show NULL for product info
- Document the issue and explain your choice!

### 3. NULL vs Missing Relationships
**Problem:** `review_score = NULL` could mean two things:
1. Order has no review (no matching row in reviews table)
2. Review exists but score is NULL (unlikely)

**Solution:** Use `IS NULL` checks on the foreign key (`review_id`), not the data columns.

## Tips for Students

### Start Simple, Build Up
1. **First:** Explore individual tables (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY)
2. **Then:** Join two tables (orders + customers)
3. **Then:** Join three tables (orders + order_items + products)
4. **Finally:** Complex multi-table joins with aggregations

### Validate Your Joins
Always check:
```sql
-- Before join: How many orders?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;  -- Should be 99,441

-- After join: How many rows?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;  -- Should be 112,650

-- Why the difference? One-to-many relationship!
```

### Use Table Aliases
```sql
-- ❌ Hard to read
SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE order_id = '123';

-- ✅ Clear, especially with multiple tables
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_city
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### Check for Unmatched Rows
```sql
-- Products never ordered (use this pattern for LEFT/RIGHT JOIN practice)
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_category_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
WHERE oi.order_id IS NULL;
```

---

## Need Help?

**Common issues:**

- **"Too many rows after join!"** → You have a one-to-many relationship. Use `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` or aggregate at the correct grain.
- **"Some products show NULL"** → Foreign key doesn't exist in dimension table. Decide: INNER JOIN (exclude) or LEFT JOIN (keep with NULLs).
- **"Dates won't parse"** → DuckDB handles this automatically for ISO format. If issues, use `CAST(... AS TIMESTAMP)`.
- **"Category names are in Portuguese"** → Join with `product_category_name_translation.csv`.

**For more examples, see Day 2 teaching notebooks:**
- `notebooks/day2_block_a_01_joins_basics.ipynb`
- `notebooks/day2_block_a_02_join_patterns.ipynb`

---

## Advanced Exercises

Once comfortable with basic joins, try:

1. **Calculate seller performance:**
   - Join: order_items → sellers → reviews
   - Metric: Average review score per seller
   - Filter: Only sellers with 10+ orders

2. **Customer lifetime value:**
   - Join: customers → orders → order_items
   - Metric: Total revenue per customer
   - Rank: Top 100 customers by revenue

3. **Product category trends:**
   - Join: products → order_items → orders
   - Group by: Month and category
   - Visualize: Revenue trends over time

4. **Delivery performance:**
   - Compare `order_estimated_delivery_date` vs `order_delivered_customer_date`
   - Calculate: Percentage on-time delivery by seller
   - Insight: Which sellers consistently deliver on time?

5. **Geographic analysis (use geolocation table):**
   - Join: customers → geolocation
   - Calculate: Distance between customer and seller
   - Insight: How does distance affect delivery time?

# Block B: DummyJSON Products API

**Source:** DummyJSON - Fake REST API for Testing and Prototyping  
**URL:** https://dummyjson.com/docs/products  
**License:** Public API, no authentication required  
**File:** `block_b/products.json`  
**Used in:** Day 2 Block B (JSON Normalization and API Ingestion)

---

## Dataset Description

This is a **JSON dataset from DummyJSON**, a free fake REST API designed for testing and prototyping. It contains 100 products with realistic e-commerce data including nested objects, arrays, and one-to-many relationships.

This dataset is perfect for teaching JSON normalization because it contains **multiple levels of nesting** that must be flattened and normalized into relational tables. Students will learn to parse complex JSON structures, extract nested data, and transform them into clean relational schemas.

**Why this dataset?**
- ✅ Rich nested structure (objects within objects, arrays of objects)
- ✅ Real-world API response format (like actual e-commerce APIs)
- ✅ Multiple normalization opportunities (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- ✅ No authentication required (students focus on data transformation, not API complexity)
- ✅ Business-relevant (product catalog with reviews - recognizable domain)
- ✅ Manageable size (100 products, 300 reviews, 203KB) - easy to inspect

---

## Dataset Structure

### Top-Level Response

```json
{
  "products": [ ... ],  // Array of 100 product objects
  "total": 194,         // Total products available in API
  "skip": 0,            // Pagination offset
  "limit": 100          // Number of products returned
}
```

### Product Object Structure

    "updatedAt": "2025-04-16T15:35:13.476Z",
    "barcode": "9164035109868",

## Nested Structures (Normalization Opportunities!)

### 1. `dimensions` - Nested Object (Flatten to Columns)

**Structure:** Object with 3 keys
```json
"dimensions": {
  "width": 15.14,
  "height": 13.08,
  "depth": 22.99
}
```

**Normalization strategy:** Flatten to columns in products table
- `product_width`, `product_height`, `product_depth`

---

### 2. `reviews` - Nested Array of Objects (One-to-Many Relationship)

**Structure:** Array of review objects
```json
"reviews": [
  {
    "rating": 3,
    "comment": "Would not recommend!",
    "date": "2025-04-30T09:41:02.053Z",
    "reviewerName": "Eleanor Collins",
    "reviewerEmail": "eleanor.collins@x.dummyjson.com"
  },
  ...
]
```

**Statistics:**
- Total reviews across 100 products: **300 reviews**
- Average reviews per product: **3 reviews**

**Normalization strategy:** Create separate `reviews` table
- Primary key: Generate `review_id`
- Foreign key: `product_id` → `products.id`
- Columns: `rating`, `comment`, `date`, `reviewerName`, `reviewerEmail`

---

### 3. `tags` - Simple Array (Many-to-Many Relationship)

**Structure:** Array of strings
```json
"tags": ["beauty", "mascara"]
```

**Statistics:**
- Unique tags across all products: **81 tags**
- Tags per product: Varies (typically 2-3)

**Normalization strategy:** Two options:

**Option A: Bridge table (many-to-many)**
- `product_tags` table with (`product_id`, `tag`)
- Allows querying "all products with tag X"

**Option B: JSON column** (if database supports it)
- Keep as JSON array in DuckDB
- Use JSON functions to query

---

### 4. `meta` - Nested Object (Flatten to Columns)

**Structure:** Object with metadata
```json
"meta": {
  "createdAt": "2025-04-16T15:35:13.476Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-04-16T15:35:13.476Z",
  "barcode": "9164035109868",
  "qrCode": "https://dummyjson.com/public/qr-code.png"
}
```

**Normalization strategy:** Flatten to columns in products table
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `barcode`, `qr_code`

---

### 5. `images` - Array of URLs (One-to-Many Relationship)

**Structure:** Array of image URLs
```json
"images": [
  "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/products/images/beauty/...",
  ...
]
```

**Normalization strategy:** Two options:

**Option A: Separate table**
- `product_images` table with (`image_id`, `product_id`, `image_url`)

**Option B: JSON column or comma-separated**
- Simpler for this use case (typically 1-2 images)

---

## Normalized Schema Design

After normalization, the JSON should be transformed into these tables:

### Table 1: `products` (Main Table)

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `id` | INTEGER | `id` (PK) |
| `title` | VARCHAR | `title` |
| `description` | TEXT | `description` |
| `category` | VARCHAR | `category` |
| `price` | DECIMAL | `price` |
| `discount_percentage` | DECIMAL | `discountPercentage` |
| `rating` | DECIMAL | `rating` |
| `stock` | INTEGER | `stock` |
| `brand` | VARCHAR | `brand` |
| `sku` | VARCHAR | `sku` |
| `weight` | INTEGER | `weight` |
| `width` | DECIMAL | `dimensions.width` (flattened) |
| `height` | DECIMAL | `dimensions.height` (flattened) |
| `depth` | DECIMAL | `dimensions.depth` (flattened) |
| `warranty_info` | VARCHAR | `warrantyInformation` |
| `shipping_info` | VARCHAR | `shippingInformation` |
| `availability` | VARCHAR | `availabilityStatus` |
| `return_policy` | VARCHAR | `returnPolicy` |
| `min_order_qty` | INTEGER | `minimumOrderQuantity` |
| `barcode` | VARCHAR | `meta.barcode` (flattened) |
| `qr_code` | VARCHAR | `meta.qrCode` (flattened) |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | `meta.createdAt` (flattened) |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | `meta.updatedAt` (flattened) |
| `thumbnail` | VARCHAR | `thumbnail` |

---

### Table 2: `reviews` (One-to-Many from Products)

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `review_id` | INTEGER | Generated (PK) |
| `product_id` | INTEGER | Parent product `id` (FK) |
| `rating` | INTEGER | `reviews[].rating` |
| `comment` | TEXT | `reviews[].comment` |
| `date` | TIMESTAMP | `reviews[].date` |
| `reviewer_name` | VARCHAR | `reviews[].reviewerName` |
| `reviewer_email` | VARCHAR | `reviews[].reviewerEmail` |

**Expected rows:** 300 reviews (from 100 products)

---

### Table 3: `product_tags` (Many-to-Many Bridge)

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `product_id` | INTEGER | Parent product `id` (FK) |
| `tag` | VARCHAR | `tags[]` (exploded) |

**Expected rows:** ~200-250 rows (100 products × 2-3 tags each)

---

### Table 4: `product_images` (One-to-Many - Optional)

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `image_id` | INTEGER | Generated (PK) |
| `product_id` | INTEGER | Parent product `id` (FK) |
| `image_url` | VARCHAR | `images[]` (exploded) |

**Expected rows:** ~100-150 rows (most products have 1-2 images)

---

## Sample Python Code

### Load and Parse JSON

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load JSON file
with open('data/day2/block_b/products.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract products array
products = data['products']
print(f"Loaded {len(products)} products")

# Inspect first product
print(products[0].keys())
```

### Normalize `products` Table (Flatten Nested Objects)

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create base products dataframe
products_df = pd.DataFrame(products)

# Flatten dimensions
products_df['width'] = products_df['dimensions'].apply(lambda x: x['width'])
products_df['height'] = products_df['dimensions'].apply(lambda x: x['height'])
products_df['depth'] = products_df['dimensions'].apply(lambda x: x['depth'])

# Flatten meta
products_df['barcode'] = products_df['meta'].apply(lambda x: x['barcode'])
products_df['qr_code'] = products_df['meta'].apply(lambda x: x['qrCode'])
products_df['created_at'] = products_df['meta'].apply(lambda x: x['createdAt'])
products_df['updated_at'] = products_df['meta'].apply(lambda x: x['updatedAt'])

# Drop original nested columns
products_df = products_df.drop(columns=['dimensions', 'meta', 'reviews', 'tags', 'images'])

print(products_df.head())
```

### Normalize `reviews` Table (Explode Nested Array)

```python
# Extract reviews from all products
reviews_list = []

for product in products:
    product_id = product['id']
    for review in product['reviews']:
        review_row = {
            'product_id': product_id,
            'rating': review['rating'],
            'comment': review['comment'],
            'date': review['date'],
            'reviewer_name': review['reviewerName'],
            'reviewer_email': review['reviewerEmail']
        }
        reviews_list.append(review_row)

reviews_df = pd.DataFrame(reviews_list)
reviews_df['review_id'] = range(1, len(reviews_df) + 1)  # Generate PK

print(f"Total reviews: {len(reviews_df)}")
print(reviews_df.head())
```

### Normalize `product_tags` Table (Explode Simple Array)

```python
# Extract tags from all products
tags_list = []

for product in products:
    product_id = product['id']
    for tag in product['tags']:
        tags_list.append({
            'product_id': product_id,
            'tag': tag
        })

tags_df = pd.DataFrame(tags_list)
print(f"Total product-tag relationships: {len(tags_df)}")
print(f"Unique tags: {tags_df['tag'].nunique()}")
print(tags_df.head())
```

### Load into DuckDB

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create tables from dataframes
con.register('products', products_df)
con.register('reviews', reviews_df)
con.register('product_tags', tags_df)

# Query: Average rating by category
result = con.execute("""
    SELECT
        p.category,
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as num_products,
        AVG(r.rating) as avg_review_rating
    FROM products p
    INNER JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
    GROUP BY p.category
    ORDER BY avg_review_rating DESC
""").fetchdf()

print(result)
```

## Learning Objectives

By working with this dataset, students will practice:

### Block B: JSON Normalization (Day 2 Focus)

**Core Concepts:**
1. **JSON structure** - Nested objects, arrays of objects, simple arrays
2. **Flattening nested objects** - Extract keys to columns (dimensions, meta)
3. **Exploding nested arrays** - Transform one-to-many into separate table (reviews)
4. **Many-to-many relationships** - Bridge tables for tags
5. **Type handling** - Converting JSON strings to proper types (dates, decimals)
6. **Primary key generation** - Creating surrogate keys for child tables
7. **Foreign key relationships** - Maintaining relationships after normalization

**Key Skills:**
- Parsing JSON from file or API
- Identifying nested structures
- Deciding when to flatten vs create new table
- Writing Python loops to extract nested data
- Using pandas to structure normalized data
- Loading normalized data into DuckDB
- Querying across normalized tables

**Business Questions:**
- What's the average review rating by product category?
- Which products have the highest ratings?
- What are the most common tags?
- Which products have the most reviews?
- What percentage of products are low stock?

## Teaching Notes

### Why DummyJSON for Day 2?

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Day 2 Block B:** Focus on JSON normalization (data transformation complexity)
- **Day 3:** Focus on API complexity (auth, rate limits, error handling, multi-source)

By using a simple API on Day 2, students can focus entirely on:
- Understanding nested JSON structures
- Deciding how to normalize (flatten vs separate table)
- Writing transformation code
- Validating results

**No authentication required** - Students don't need API keys, can run locally from cached JSON.

### Comparison to Real-World APIs

This structure mirrors real e-commerce APIs:
- **Shopify API:** Similar product + variants + reviews structure
- **Amazon API:** Similar nested product attributes
- **E-commerce platforms:** Commonly return nested data requiring normalization

Students who master this dataset will be able to work with real production APIs.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting to Generate Primary Keys
**Problem:** Reviews table needs a `review_id` but JSON doesn't provide one.

**Solution:** Generate using `range()` or `row_number()`
```python
reviews_df['review_id'] = range(1, len(reviews_df) + 1)
```

### 2. Losing Foreign Key Relationship
**Problem:** When extracting reviews, forgetting to include `product_id`.

**Solution:** Always capture parent ID when iterating:
```python
for product in products:
    product_id = product['id']  # ← Capture this!
    for review in product['reviews']:
        review_row = {'product_id': product_id, ...}
```

### 3. Not Handling NULL/Missing Values
**Problem:** Some products might not have all nested fields.

**Solution:** Use `.get()` with defaults:
```python
width = product.get('dimensions', {}).get('width', None)
```

### 4. Type Confusion
**Problem:** Dates are strings, not datetime objects.

**Solution:** Convert types explicitly:
```python
reviews_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(reviews_df['date'])
```

## Advanced Exercises

Once comfortable with basic normalization, try:

1. **Category hierarchy:**
   - Some categories have parent-child relationships (e.g., "beauty" → "mascara")
   - Create a category dimension table

2. **Review sentiment analysis:**
   - Analyze review comments for positive/negative sentiment
   - Compare sentiment score to numeric rating

3. **Price analytics:**
   - Calculate actual price after discount
   - Find products with highest discount percentage
   - Group by category and compare pricing

4. **Inventory analysis:**
   - Identify low-stock products (stock < minimum order quantity)
   - Calculate total inventory value (stock × price)

5. **Tag analysis:**
   - Find most common tags
   - Products with most tags
   - Tag co-occurrence analysis (which tags appear together?)
